## Summary
Reading through the Hands-On Machine Learning book by Aurelien Geron (2019). Each folder contains a different project from the book for implementation practice. Practice using Jupyter Notebooks, python and virtual development environments, and a multitude of machine learning and deep learning library concepts such as artificial neural networks, perceptrons, training vs testing datasets, etc.

## Setup & Usage
Load repository, activate virtual environment/install packages, and use jupyter-notebook --no-browser on the commandline and then open manually (if using WSL2 for development like I am)

## Potential Improvements
...

## Technologies
* Python 3.*
* Pyenv and venv are used for Python virtual environments
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Powerful python packages and libraries for data science including Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, etc.

## Inspiration
Interested by all of these concepts; got a really good mark in a related University course which sparked my interest in this type of data analysis and its use cases (which are inummerable)

## Sources
Some deviations may occur and examples taken from online but the book is the primary source.
